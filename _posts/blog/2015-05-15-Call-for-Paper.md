# Hack.lu 2015 Call for Papers, Presentations and Workshops

`I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.` Mark Twain

The purpose  of the  hack.lu convention  is to give  an open  and free
playground   where  people   can  discuss   the  implication   of  new
technologies in  society.  hack.lu is a balanced  mix convention where
technical  and non-technical  people can  meet each  others  and share
freely all  kind of information.  The  convention will be  held in the
Grand-Duchy of  Luxembourg in October (20-22.10.2015).  The most
significant  new  discoveries   about  computer  network  attacks  and
defenses,  commercial  security solutions,  and  pragmatic real  world
security  experience will  be  presented  in a  three  days series  of
informative tutorials.   We would like to announce  the opportunity to
submit papers,  and/or lightning talk  proposals for selection  by the
hack.lu  technical  review  committee.  This  year we  will  be  doing
workshops on the first day PM and talks of 1 hour  or  30 minutes  in
