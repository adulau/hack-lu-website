Keynote - Unpatchable: Living with a Vulnerable Implanted Device
----------------------------------------------------------------
by Marie Moe

My life depends on the functioning of a medical device, a pacemaker that generates each and every beat of my heart. This computer inside of me may fail due to hardware and software issues, due to misconfigurations or network-connectivity.

Yes, you read that correctly. The pacemaker has a wireless interface for remote monitoring and I am forced to become a human part of the Internet-of-Things. As a seasoned security-professional I am worried about my heart's attack surface.

This talk will be focused on the problem that we have these life critical devices with vulnerabilities that can't easily be patched without performing surgery on patients, my personal experience with being the host of such a device, and how the hacker community can proceed to work with the vendors to secure the devices.

Keynote - Internet of Tchotchke
-------------------------------
by Paul Rascagnères

In this presentation the author will describe his journey into the domain of reverse engineering hardware and embedded systems. He will explain why and how he discovered this domain, the "mandatory hardware", the different technologies and of course some important use cases:

* analysis of an ATM skimmer
* analysis of an encrypted hard drive + physical hack + software patching
* analysis of an embedded Linux device
* analysis of an embedded Windows 10 IoT device

He will finish his presentation with the extension of his work to malware developers and targeted attacks. Some of these cases already exist: malware on the Internet backbone, custom firmware on payment terminals, custom firmware in network appliance, etc. -  What's next ?


Trusting Files Formats: Illusions or Reality?
---------------------------------------------
by Ange Albertini

What is our biggest fear when we double-click an icon, when our system opens an external file?
Being hacked! You know it, because this is what the medias would make their headlines about.

Crashing an app or your system is also a risk, but it's not that scary in comparison.

And besides... What else could happen? it's fine...

It's fine, because we always have the sweet illusion that by reading the specs of its file format, we'd get a clear understanding of what
that file is supposed to do.

As if... ;) Can we still trust file formats?

On top of that, while preservationists want to store reliably information for ever, infosec people are ready to ban a file format if it doesn't match
security standards...

Can we trust their future?

How Mobile Applications Are Redefining Information Controls Inside of Iran
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Mahsa Alimardani

As Internet users increasingly connect to the Internet through smartphones, this has transformed Iran’s Internet ecology towards an increasing reliance and production in apps. In Iran, a country that practises some of the most stringent censorship and surveillance techniques in the world has seen this transformation reshape the way the government implements information controls online. While applications with popular usage on browsers such as Facebook and Twitter remain blocked through their mobile applications, platforms that predominantly exist in app form such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Instagram remain unblocked in the country. This talk will look at how the government is counteracting these policies through various means, including local imitation apps, and new programs such as ‘intelligent filtering’, and the Revolutionary Guards' “Spider” program. Additionally, a discussion of how Iranian Internet users use these platforms, especially in reference to digital security awareness and practices will be included.

Geek usages for your Fitbit Flex tracker
----------------------------------------
by Axelle Apvrille

Fitness Flex is a fitness wristband which records your fitness activity: walking, running - and also sleep efficiency.
Since prior infamous security and privacy issues - such as public web disclosure of sexual activity - Fitbit has made significant progress. While reverse engineering, we noticed trackers now use end to end encryption for their communications with Fitbit servers.
Is this good? or bad?
What happens if Fitbit servers are unreachable ? What can we possibly do with the wristband besides activity tracking?

I'll present two alternative geeky usages to your beloved fitness tracker.

Key-Logger, Video, Mouse - How to turn your KVM into a raging key-logging monster
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Yaniv Balmas, Lior Oppenheim

Key-Loggers are cool, really cool. It seems, however, that every conceivable aspect of key-logging has already been covered: from physical devices to hooking techniques. What possible innovation could be left in this field?
Well, that's what we used to think too. That is until we noticed that little grey box sitting there underneath a monitor, next to yesterday's dirty coffee cup. The little grey box that is most commonly known as 'KVM'.
The talk will tell the tale of our long journey to transform an innocent KVM into a raging key-logging monster.
We will safely guide you through the embedded wastelands, past unknown IC's, to explore uncharted serial protocols and unravel monstrous obfuscation techniques.
Walking along the misty firmware woods of 8051 assembly we will challenge ambiguous functions, and confront undebuggable environments.

Finally, we will present a live demo of our POC code and show you that air-gapped networks might not be as segregated as you imagined.
You will witness that malware code could actually reside outside your computer, persisting through reboots, wipes, formats, and even hardware replacements.
You might laugh, you might cry, but one thing is certain - you will never look at your KVM the same as before.

Forging the USB armory
----------------------
By Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco

The availability of modern System on a Chip (SoC) parts, having low power consumption and high integration of most computer components in a single chip, empowers the open source community in creating all kind of embedded systems.

The presentation illustrates the journey that we have taken to develop an open hardware board first of its kind: the USB armory, an open source hardware design, implementing a flash drive sized computer for security applications.

The security features of the USB armory System on a Chip (SoC), combined with the openness of the board design, is meant to empower developers and users with a fully customizable USB trusted device for open and innovative personal security
applications.

The presentation explores the lessons learned in making a small form factor, high specifications, embedded device with solely open source tools, its architecture and security features such as secure boot and ARM TrustZone implementation.

The security applications of the implemented concept are explored, illustrating the advantage of an open USB device with increased computational power.  
The first open source application for the platform, developed by Inverse Path, for advanced file encryption functionality, will also be covered.


Keys? Where we're going, we don't need keys
-------------------------------------------
by Damien Cauquil

Smartlocks are the new way of securing doors by replacing the old mechanical locks by new high-tech and connected locks, able to
communicate with other smart devices such as smartphones and computers.
Vendors argue that "key dematerialization" is the future of keys, where anybody would be able to give, control and revoke keys for one or
multiple locks by using his smartphone. No more physical keys needed for a better control, they say.

We'll go through the challenges of key dematerialization in the actual world, from technical challenges to real world implementations ... and failures.

Widespread smartlocks (and padlocks) are not so smart, and developers often fail at correctly implementing cryptographic algorithms (especially when the smartlock is advertised as using a strong AES-256 implementation), and of course security by obscurity is still used and broken when dealing with critical embedded systems.

During this talk, we're going to demonstrate some real world attacks on one of these smartlocks, from information leaks to "wireless lockpicking" through fuzzing.

Draw me a Local Kernel Debugger
-------------------------------
by Samuel Chevet and Clément Rouault

Local Kernel Debugging is the ability to perform kernel-mode debugging on a
single computer. In other words, the debugger runs on the same computer
that is being debugged. Windows offers this functionality through windbg and kd
binaries which allow to read/write the kernel memory, perform in/out and access MSRs.

This presentation will explain how dbgengine (core of windbg) works: which APIs are
exposed and what it requires to work properly. We will show how to abuse it to
be able to perform Local Kernel Debugging in Python. Finally, we demonstrate its
interest throught use cases.

Security of Virtual Desktop Infrastructures: from great concepts to bad surprises
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Maxime Clementz, Simon Petitjean

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure hosts users' desktop environments on remote servers which are accessed over a network using a remote display protocol from specific client software or hardware such as Thin-client or Zero-client.
We encountered such solutions during pentests in high-security networks. Moreover, we had the opportunity to study one specific commercial implementation: we identified and exploited several flaws that allow taking over the whole infrastructure.
We've had some fun hacking this technology so we would like to share our experience by explaining our findings and giving tips to mitigate the critical vulnerabilities we found.
**SPOILER**: responsible disclosure is simultaneously launched with this paper submission. Of course, the content of our final presentation will depend on the outcome of the discussion with the editor.

Binary Constraint Solving with LLVM
-----------------------------------
by Sophia D'Antoine


This talk will show how to perform a full chain control flow attack against a complex, stand-alone application.
Specifically, how to use mcsema, llvm, and satisfiability solvers to discover a targeted execution path using side channel analysis. From this we show how to traverse this path to collect path constraints and solve for user input which would give us the desired output.
This process can then be applied to any targeted behavior in a program, from finding known vulnerability characteristics to simply supplying the correct input to a 'crackme' binary.

A demonstration will conclude the talk by solving an obfuscated 'crackme' challenge using the above described process as well as a mini 'competition' by running a pintool solver and a pysymemu solver against the same binary and comparing to see which gets the flag first.

Advances in Secure Messaging Protocols
--------------------------------------
by Frederic Jacobs

Along with the Snowden revelations, there's been a surge of interest in end-to-end security for messaging. This idea is nothing new, OTR and PGP have been around for some time but failed to get widespread adoption.

We discuss the desirable cryptographic properties of secure messaging protocols and show how they are achieved in practice in different protocols. We also show how multiple newcomers to the secure messaging space are reducing metadata trails and discuss impact it has on fighting abuse such as spam.

Learn from Malwares, A Practical guide of spear phishing for Red Teams
----------------------------------------------------------------------
by Paul Jung

Malware writers are definitively security researchers. For years, bad
guys spend time to find smart or tricky solutions to bypass enterprise
security. This presentations is about techniques seen recently and
reused in red team penetration tests. Amazingly these technics are quite
simple to reuse and usually don't need extensive skills. This
presentation will cover all aspect of spear a  phishing attack, from
email harvesting, email spoofing up to spear forging bypassing AV and
APT boxes. We will also talk about tips for improving click rate and
solutions to escape enterprise security devices. All these tips should
not be only seen as an evil guide for bad peoples. It's a warn a for
everyone implied in computer security in order to align deployed
security to modern and commonly used threats.

How not to build an electronic voting system
--------------------------------------------
by Quentin Kaiser

Back in 1994, Belgium was one of the first European country to push for the deployment of electronic voting systems. Thought at the time as a sign of Belgium stepping foot in the 21st century, the system stayed in use up to the latest European elections that took place in May 2014. As years passed, bugs got discovered, issues were raised, and public concern grew up to the point where the government was obliged by law to publish the source code of those systems. We jumped on the opportunity to audit the code in June 2014, a few days after the #bug2505 debacle.
By auditing the source code provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs, we found multiple vulnerabilities in the system that could easily be exploited by an attacker to tamper with the election process.

This presentation will cover all the Belgian election system components, from the different implementations of ballot boxes to the infrastructure responsible of counting each and every vote. Our ultimate goal is to cast a light on bad security practices we found in election management systems so it hopefully get fixed by the next election year.

Totally Spies!
--------------
by Marion Marschalek, Paul Rascagnères, Joan Calvet


In March 2014 a set of slides were leaked from the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC), outlining operation SNOWGLOBE which involves a mysterious malware dubbed Babar that has been spotted spying on Canadian institutions as well as attacking institutions in Iran and other targets in the middle east. CSEC attributed the attacks "with moderate certainty" to a French intelligence agency.
The group behind Babar is now commonly referred to as "AnimalFarm" in antimalware industry, suggesting Babar was only a small piece of a much bigger puzzle. Since CSEC slides' publication, a group of valorous adventurers, animated by the thrill of understanding complex malware operations, has been relentlessly following SNOWGLOBE's trail. Along its path, this group found several pieces of AnimalFarm's arsenal, for example stealthy Casper, exotic Bunny and even big ears Babar itself. The newest heavy-weight actor on the list of miscreants is Dino, the espionage dinosaur.

This presentation aims to provide a global picture on SNOWGLOBE's operations and also delve into technical quirks of their malware. An assessment of the connection between their various piece of software will be given from a reverse engineer's perspective, and what technical hints regarding attribution can be found.

HackingTeam - how they infected your Android device by 0days
------------------------------------------------------------
by Attila Marosi

There is no need to make a long introduction when speaking about the famous Remote Control System (RCS), the product of the Italian company Hacking Team. The huge amount - 400 Gb - of leaked data gives rise to lengthy discussion and is extremely concerning for every part of the professionally, politically or even those superficially interested only.

This presentation has three parts: The first is a quick introduction, what the concept and the environment look like (Exploit Delivery Network - Android, Fake App Store...), how the malware was delivered to the targets; and how the infected devices were controlled through the proxy chain.

The second is a detailed analysis of the exploits which were used to infect Android devices. I will give a step-by-step description of the installation (infection) process. Hacking Team has many 0day exploits to install the application and to elevate privileges on those devices. These exploits will also be presented. The third part is a collection of the interesting techniques that were used to keep the application as silent and undetectable as possible (VM and Cuckoo evasion, Anti-Virus detection project… etc.).

A Collective View of Current Trends in Criminal Hosting Infrastructures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
by Dhia Mahjoub

From new exploits and antivirus evasion techniques to traffic direction services and compromised data reselling: the digital crime landscape is in continuous progress.

Despite the large variety of specialized and innovative cybercrime services, some of them such as domain names and bulletproof hosting are cross-functional since they are fundamental to practically all cyber criminal campaigns.

Exploit kits are currently one of the most efficient malware delivery mechanisms. A successful Exploit kit infection chain drops anything from financial trojans, crypto-ransomware, to info-stealers and click-fraud or DDoS bots. Exploit kit landing domains are commonly hosted on bulletproof hosting providers or abused large providers.

By leveraging our worldwide visibility into the attack surface in terms of DNS and IP space, we will present numerous new use cases of criminal hosting infrastructures used for botnet proxy networks and Exploit kits such as Angler, Nuclear, RIG, etc.

We will share actionable intelligence collected for about two years worth of investigation that attendees can utilize in turn in mitigating malware.
We will describe evolving patterns of TTPs used by adversaries in setting up their infrastructures for resilience and scale. Such patterns include improper peering relationships, offshore registration of hosting businesses, diversification of IP space across various RIRs, rogue ASNs and affiliated hosters, usage of compromised registrant accounts, hosting of EK landing domains on multiple IPs across dispersed hosters, etc.

How digital forensics met threat intelligence
---------------------------------------------
by Ronan Mouchoux, Thomas Chopitea


Blue-team infosec is all about defending against an opponent. And as we all know, knowing (or "gathering intelligence on" your opponent is becoming crucial: being able to know (and to predict) your opponent's moves greatly reduces the cost of defending against their attacks.

This talk will (re-)introduce the concept of Threat Intelligence as we understand it today, leaving misconceptions behind and exploring the concepts and models that have already been developed to describe it, and see how it relates to "classical" intelligence.

Using concrete examples we'll see exactly how threat intelligence fits in the incident response process, ranging from preparation to lessons learned, and how dismissing it as snake oil can have a negative effect on the defenders. We'll also expose the some tools and processes that help DFIRers collect, manage, and use threat intelligence today, including their aspirations and limitations.

They Hate Us 'Cause They Ain't Us - How We Broke the Internet
-------------------------------------------------------------
by Netanel Rubin

The InfoSec community likes to argue. From conference ethics & dress codes, through disclosure policies, the security of open/closed source software, and whether vulnerabilities should be allowed fancy names and logos. Thankfully, nobody argues with 0-days, that's why we found a dozen of them, In the most popular web applications in the world.

This talk will give one hacker's perspective of the Hackers vs. Developers never-ending debate. We will show the critical differences and the gaping asymmetry of how each side perceives the world and views code, and come to the unavoidable conclusion: they hate us cause they ain't us.

Starting with the MediaWiki vulnerability (RCE on wikipedia.org) we discovered last year, we will delve into increasingly significant fails in modern web application software, all the way up to dropping vulnerabilities in absolute web giants, revealing findings awarded with max bounty payouts of >$10,000s USD.

For each vulnerability, we will explore the context of the vulnerable code, looking through the eyes of the developer, and witness the true absurdity of the secure coding fallacy.
We'll show that no matter how much money is spent on security, despite security awareness training sessions and rigorous code reviews, vulnerabilities still exist in the most secure code, simply because developers just don't have the privilege of thinking like hackers.

Scrutinizing WPA2 Password Generating Algorithms in Wireless Routers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
by Eduardo Novella

A wireless router is a networking device that enables a user to set up a wireless connection to the Internet. A router can offer a secure channel by cryptographic means which provides authenticity and confidentiality. Nowadays, almost all routers use a secure channel by default that is based on Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2). This is a security protocol which is believed not to be susceptible to practical key recovery attacks. However, the passwords should have sufficient entropy to avert brute force attacks.

In this research, we compose a strategy on how to reverse-engineer embedded routers. Furthermore, we describe a procedure that can instantly gather a complete wireless authentication trace which enables an offline password recovery attack. Finally, we present a number of use cases where we identify extremely weak password generating algorithms in various routers which are massively deployed in The Netherlands.

The algorithms are used to generate the default WPA2 password. Such a password is loaded during device initialization and hardware reset. Users that did not explicitly change their wireless password are most likely vulnerable to practical attacks which can recover their password within minutes. A stolen password allows an adversary to abuse someone else’s internet connection, for instance compromising the firewall, making a fraudulent transaction or performing other criminal activities. Together with the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre we have initiated a responsible disclosure procedure. However, since these routers are also used by many other companies in various countries, our findings seem to relate an international industry wide security issue.

Bio: Eduardo Novella
--------------------

Eduardo Novella has been finishing his studies abroad at the Radboud University Nijmegen. He is a security analyst at Riscure in The Netherlands where performs security evaluations on embedded devices. Before joining Riscure, he was messing around with wireless routers. Concretely, he was wondering how WPA2 keys were generated by some ISPs. He took several Dutch routers for research and got the answer. He will show how to extract and reverse engineer firmware images, and subsequently how to break the weak cryptography within a few minutes.


Security Design and High-Risk Users
-----------------------------------
by Eleanor Saitta

Security is a property of human outcomes, not technical systems. The security community understands how to think about the security of code and is learning how to think about the security of large systems, but has barely begun to start to think about how to improve security outcomes for humans. Security for humans affects the entire software development and deployment lifecycle, but it's most strongly present in the design and requirements phase where it has been largely ignored by the security community. The need for outcome-oriented security design is particularly obvious in the design of systems intended for use by high-risk, specifically-targeted users. In this talk, we'll describe the security design problem, the challenges of supporting high-risk users, and some steps toward practical processes and solutions for the missing discipline in the security community.

Stegosploit - Delivering Drive-By Exploits With Only Images
-----------------------------------------------------------
by Saumil Shah

Stegosploit creates a new way to encode "drive-by" browser exploits and deliver them through image files. These payloads are undetectable using current means. This paper discusses two broad underlying techniques used for image based exploit delivery - Steganography and Polyglots. Drive-by browser exploits are steganographically encoded into JPG and PNG images. The resultant image file is fused with HTML and Javascript decoder code, turning it into an HTML+Image polyglot. The polyglot looks and feels like an image, but is decoded and triggered in a victim's browser when loaded.

The Stegosploit Toolkit contains the tools necessary to test image based exploit delivery. A case study of a Use-After-Free memory corruption exploit (CVE-2014-0282) shall be presented demonstrating the Stegosploit technique.

Crema: A LangSec-Inspired Programming Language
----------------------------------------------
by Jacob Torrey and Mark Bridgman

We discuss the potential for significant reduction in size and complexity of verification tasks for input-handling software when such software follows the LangSec principles, i.e., is designed and compiled for a suitably limited computational model, no stronger than needed for the recognizer automaton of a particular language of inputs. Such a language, Crema is introduced and provided as open-source. We use parts of the qmail parsing code base compared to a restricted parsing environment as a case study, and LLVM and KLEE to estimate the size of its respective verification tasks. We also study the application of the same principles to the verification of reference monitors. Examples of programming with a provably-halting programming language are given as well as how to embed them into your existing programs.

Why Johnny Can't Unpack: Toward One Click Unpacking
---------------------------------------------------
by Shift

Johnny is frustrated, he can't unpack malware. Nor does his latest sandbox which his organization acquired from some Fortune-100 company, nor does his cloud service which his company pays a few k's every month for. Every day he's struggling to analyze malware in order grab intelligence from the latest malware his organization got infected in , but he's looking for something different, something which might assist him to analyze high amounts of packed and obfuscated malware.

In this research I show the journey of "Why Johnny can't Unpack", I start by showing the general problem of unpacking in comparison to the halting problem and then move onto the different complications unpacking obfuscated and protected code has with nowadays protectors. Next, I move onto explaining how it is possible to achieve how percentage of unpacking rate using a debugger-free environment using VMI and program analysis techniques.

Using the aforementioned techniques, we are able to achieve high unpacking rate and the ability to correlate binaries, basic blocks and even families to achieve better malware unpacking results, however we can also expand this research into the next 20% which involves deobfuscation and program transformation by transforming VM-bytecode into x86.

By combining the aforementioned techniques, we are able to achieve high unpacking rate and the ability to correleate between binaries, basic blocks and even different malware families. However, we can also expand this research into fully deobfuscating a program which was whiteboxed or transformed by VM-code or program whitening techniques.

Breaking Yet Another Digital Divide: Bringing the Tech World into the Discussion on Digital Literacy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This talk intends to contribute to the discussions taking place around media literacy and to invite the tech community to join this conversation. I will discuss the current trends in terms of digital literacy and the current debates taking place in the world of education sciences and information technology. I wish to illustrate how certain subjects that are predominant in the world of technology remain largely absent in the learning and education research networks and vice versa.

I will also propose to discuss the different ways in which the tech world can participate and contribute. In fact, one of the arguments I will defend is the necessity of the world of education and the world of technology to join forces in a deeper way.

This, I suggest, could be translated into ways in which issues of security, censorship and surveillance, as well as their technical responses and solutions, can be made part of the discussion about digital literacy that many research groups discuss and debate in separate contexts. I believe this combination of work, which has surprisingly been apart for far too long, can be translated into bridge figures, using ideas for more complete, more coherent and more flexible strategies that can be fairly accessed, adapted and expanded.

Improving Flash Exploits Analysis
---------------------------------
by Tillmann Werner

Eight different zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player in 2015 so far, and analysts are struggling to get a handle on the problem:
Malicous Flash poses some special challenges at them when trying to answer, for example, if a particular object is malicious, if it contains
an exploit for a known vulnerability, or if variants of it have been observed before. Naturally, the answer is in the code. In this talk we
will discuss ways of making the relevant information available and use it to write signatures that allow us to identify and classify variants
of known exploit as well as understand unknown ones faster. Together with this presentation we will release swffile.py, a Python class to be
used in custom analysis tools that provides an interface for SWF file parsing.

No Need for Black Chambers: Testing TLS in the E-mail Ecosystem at Large
------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Aaron Zauner

Abstract—TLS is the most widely used cryptographic protocol on the Internet. While many recent studies focused on its use in HTTPS, none so far analyzed TLS usage in e-mail related
protocols, which often carry highly sensitive information. Since end-to-end encryption mechanisms like PGP are seldomly used,
today confidentiality in the e-mail ecosystem is mainly based on the encryption of the transport layer. A well-positioned attacker
may be able to intercept plaintext passively and at global scale.

We collected and scanned a massive data-set of 20 million IP/port combinations of all related protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) and legacy ports. Over a time span of approx. three months we conducted more than 10 billion TLS handshakes. Additionally, we show that securing server-to-server communication using e.g. SMTP is inherently more difficult than securing client-to- server communication. Lastly, we analyze the volatility of TLS certificates and trust anchors in the e-mail ecosystem and argue that while the overall trend points in the right direction, there are still many steps needed towards secure e-mail.

TrustZone on the USB armory (2 hours)
-------------------------------------
by Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco

The workshop aims to introduce the fine details of the Freescale i.MX53
TrustZone implementation, the SoC employed in the USB armory.

The ARM(R) TrustZone(R) technology, in contrast to traditional TPMs, allows
developers to engineer custom trusted platform modules by enforcing domain
separation, between the "secure" and "normal" worlds, that propagates
throughout System on a Chip (SoC) components, and therefore not only limited to
the CPU core.

The class leverages on the native TrustZone(R) support provided by the USB
armory (http://inversepath.com/usbarmory) SoC to cover its theory,
implementation, security evaluation and applications.

Additionally the additional security features of the USB armory, such as Secure
Boot and the INTERLOCK tool, will be explored in detail.

Crowdsourced Malware Triage! (2 hours)
--------------------------------------
by Sergei Frankoff, Sean Wilson

Malware triage is an important function in any mature incident response program; the process of quickly analyzing potentially malicious files or URLs to determine if your organization has exposure. But what if you don't have an incident response program? What if you are just setting one up? What if you don't have the tools you need to perform your analysis? With the current offering of free online tools and the right mindset, a web browser and a notepad may be all you need.

In this workshop you will work through the triage of a live Exploit Kit using only free online tools. We will provide an introduction and demo of each tool and support you as you perform your analysis.

This workshop is aimed at junior incident responders, hobby malware analysts, and general security or IT practitioners who are interested in learning more about the malware triage process. If you have no experience with malware analysis but you are a strong developer and understand web technologies such as Javascript and Flash you should have no problem completing the workshop.

In order to participate in this workshop you will need the following:
 - Laptop with a modern web browser and a text editor.
 - For the text editor Notepad.exe will work but you will have more fun if it has syntax highlighting. Try Notepad++ or SublimeText.
 - Good Internet connection!

Workshop BTA: an open-source Active Directory security audit framework (2 hours)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Joffrey Czarny

When it comes to the security of the information system, Active Directory domain controllers are, or should be, at the center of concerns, which are (normally) to ensure compliance with best practices, and during a compromise proved to explore the possibility of cleaning the information system without having to rebuild Active Directory. However, few tools implement this process and several ways exist to backdoor Active Directory. We propose to present some possible backdoors which could be set by an intruder in Active Directory to keep administration rights. For example, how to modify the AdminSDHolder container in order to reapply rights after administrator actions. Moreover, backdoors can be implemented in Active Directory to help an intruder to gain back his privileges.

We will present BTA, an audit tool for Active Directory databases, and our methodology for verifying the application of good practices and the absence of malicious changes in these databases.

The Workshop will be organised as follows:

- We begin by a presentation, describing the stakes around the Active Directory, centerpiece of any information system based on Microsoft technologies. Then some backdoors, in order to keep admins rights or to help an intruder to quickly recover admins rights, will be demonstrated. At last, we will present BTA and the methodology developed to analysis Active Directory.

- Thereafter, we will use (play with) BTA and try to discover backdoors within a Active Directory. We will try also to develop some miners in order to understand how BTA is architectured and show how it's easy to perform some new security checks.

More information on BTA can be found on the Bitbucket repository [https://bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta](https://bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta)

Workshop: Radare2 - a framework for reverse engineering (4 hours)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
by Julien Voisin, Anton Kochkov, Maxime Morin, Jeffrey Crowelll

Radare2 is a complete framework dedicated to reverse engineering.
Written in C, completely portable, and released under LGPL, it's a
tool of trade to deal with binaries in any form. A lot of people [1]
are currently using it for a large panel of different purposes; binary
exploitation, weird CPU architecture reversing, binary diffing, ctf,
emulation, ...

But since it is a really complete tool without a GUI, it has a steep
learning curve, hence this workshop.

In this renewed and updated workshop we will also cover debugging
techniques, using ESIL for the emulation, scripting with r2pipe,
radare2 internals and how to modify/enhance it.
