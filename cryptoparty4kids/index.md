CryptoParty4Kids
----------------


1st Cryptoparty for Kids organized at Hack.lu conference. 

  The first Cryptoparty for Kids took place on Thursday 22nd October 2015 at the Hack.lu international conference which was organized at Alvisse Parc Hotel, located in Luxembourg-Dommeldange.
	The goal of Cryptoparty for kids is to help children to understand the information communication technologies and the existing methods to secure themselves. About twenty children between 7 and 12 years old took part in the BEE SECURE event which dealt with the popularization of technologies and the ethics in the field of computer security.
Different workshops were introduced by Hack.lu speakers, all experts in computer security:


Here was the schedule:
•	An introduction to “hacking culture”.

•	Video games from the 90s: go beyond the limits of the equipment.

•	An introduction to cryptography and cryptanalysis.

•	A “networking game”: a playful and dynamic game which helped children to understand how a TCP/IP protocol works. Children also got basis in network engineering and learnt what is a DDoS attack.

•	Pieces of advice about safe online surfing were given by BEE SECURE.
 
	« Cryptoparty for kids is based on our experience in organizing Hack4kids editions in Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Children will be able to use the Internet in a responsible way because a focus on cryptography and data protection awareness will be made”, explains Matthieu Farcot from SECURITYMADEIN.LU.
	
	This first edition was a success and other editions will be organized in Luxemburgish, German and English.
